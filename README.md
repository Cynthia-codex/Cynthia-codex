# Cynthia Codex — Data Annotation & AI Training Specialist

I turn raw data into high-quality, production-ready training sets that accelerate model performance and time-to-market. I focus on precision, reproducibility, and annotation pipelines that scale for real-world ML systems.

## Core Competencies
- Data annotation: text, image, audio, video
- Annotation tooling: Labelbox, CVAT, Doccano, Prodigy, Supervisely
- Data engineering & tooling: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, data validation
- Quality assurance: inter-annotator agreement, guideline design, audit workflows
- Project workflows: dataset versioning, labeling SOPs, feedback loops for model-in-the-loop
- Compliance & privacy awareness for sensitive datasets
- ## Selected Impact
- Curated annotation guidelines and QA for a clinical NLP dataset (→ improved label consistency and model F1 by X%).  
- Built and managed an image-labeling pipeline for retail product recognition, delivering N annotated images with bounding boxes & segmentation masks.  
- Created a sentiment dataset of M annotated social posts, including multi-pass QA and dataset splits ready for model training.

## Featured Projects
- **Data Annotation Samples** — example annotations, guidelines, and scripts for quality checks. *(link: `Cynthia-codex/data-annotation-samples`)*  
- **[Project Name]** — one-line impact statement showing measurable result (accuracy increase, time saved, scale).  
- **[Project Name]** — short line about role, tools used, and outcome.
- ## How to Verify My Work
- Browse the `data-annotation-samples` repo for real examples of annotation formats, README SOPs, and QA scripts.  
- Request a short paid trial task — I can deliver a sample set with QA reports within agreed scope.
